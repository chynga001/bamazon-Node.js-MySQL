# bamazon-Node.js-MySQL
I have created the bamazonCustomer.js that manages customer level purchase of products from a mysql database.

Below are the criteria and requirments for this project. Will be adding the addition levels before required due date.

### Challenge #1: Customer View (Minimum Requirement)

Create a MySQL Database called bamazon.

Then create a Table inside of that database called products.

The products table should have each of the following columns:

### item_id (unique id for each product)

### product_name (Name of product)

### department_name

### price (cost to customer)

### stock_quantity (how much of the product is available in stores)
